# Electricity

### Electric Field Created by a Battery

When the terminals of a battery are connected using a conductive wire, the negative terminal "pushes" electrons away from it, while the positive terminal "pulls" electrons towards it. However, the "pushing" and "pulling" are not treated as or considered to be two separate forces, in fact, the negative charge at the negative terminal, and positive charge at the positive terminal are not even considered to be two separate fields. The combination of the two is considered as a single electrical field, creating a single, uniform force that drives electrons from the negative terminal to the positive terminal. The electrical field driving electrons around the circuit is analogous to gravity.

#### Potential Difference

**Potential Difference** is essentially the electric equivalent of **potential energy** as we know it in gravitational terms. You may often hear that a physical object has expended all of its potential energy (due to gravity) when it "hits the ground", or something to this effect. However, the gravitational potential energy of any physical object would only be zero if it was at the very centre of the Earth. An object laying on the ground does hold potential energy, since if a sinkhole were to open below it, it would fall downwards toward the centre of the Earth. Therefore, what actually matters is the difference in potential (aka. potential difference) between an object's position and the ground (of course, "the ground" is context-dependent, as the "ground" could refer to the floor in the penthouse on the 80th floor of a skyscraper, very far from the surface of the Earth).

While the term "potential difference" is used much more commonly in the context of electricity, and infrequently when learning about potential kinetic energy, the concept itself is essentially exactly the same.

#### Fields

A field is a region in space where a physical quantity, such as force, potential, or energy, is defined at every point within that region. Fields help describe how objects interact over a distance without physical contact.

The gravitational field (gravity) and an electrical field (such as the one created by connecting the terminals of a battery to form a circuit) are both examples of fields. The gravitational field causes physical objects within the field to move towards the centre of the Earth. Similarly, an electric field causes charged particles to move in a given direction (e.g., the electric field created by a battery causes electrons to flow through the wire in the direction of the positive terminal).

**It is the electric field that creates a potential difference between the terminals of a battery**, just like the gravitational field creates a potential difference between the top and bottom of a staircase. To (incorrectly) state that the field is created by the potential difference is like saying that gravity is created by a person having high potential at the top of a staircase versus at the bottom - i.e., it doesn't make sense. If there was no electric field, then all electrons in the wire would have the same potential energy, regardless of their position.

### Water Fountain Analogy

Consider a water fountain. There are two separate forces here:

1. **Gravity (gravitational field)**: Pulls water down the fountain.
2. **Mechanical Pump**: Moves water back up to the top of the fountain.

Just like in any other Earth-based scenario, water (molecules) at the top of the fountain have high potential energy compared to those at the bottom of the fountain. That is, they have the potential to expend kinetic energy by moving from the top of the fountain to the bottom. This is the result of being in the gravitational field, which pulls them in the direction of the Earth.

While gravity is a field, when the mechanical pump moves the water back up to the top of the fountain, it is not using a field like gravity. Even if it did use a field of some sort in its internal mechanism, this is isolated from and therefore not relevant to the field and movement of the water outside the pump (i.e., the water flowing *down* the fountain). Therefore, the water is considered to have expended all of its potential energy by the time it reaches the bottom of the fountain, and the pump "recharges" it back up with potential energy by bringing it back up to the top of the fountain.

Now, let's say we put a water wheel in the path of the falling water, so that water turns the mill as it falls down the fountain. The following happens as the water falls and turns the wheel:

* **The Earth's gravitational field** exerts a force on the water, causing it to **move (flow)** downwards (towards the Earth).
* **Energy** is transferred from the water to the water wheel, causing it to turn.
* **Resistance** is created by the water wheel, slowing the **flow** of the water.
* **Potential energy** of the water was expended, some converted to kinetic energy as the water fell (and its position in the gravitational field changed), and some transferred to the water wheel.
* **The mechanical pump** uses energy to push water back up to the top of the fountain, "recharging" its potential energy so that it can do work again on the way back down.

Let's relate this to a light filament in a DC circuit powered by a battery:

* **The electric field created by the charges at the battery's terminals** exerts a force on the electrons in the wire connecting the terminals, causing them to **move (flow)** in the direction of the positive terminal.
* **Energy** is transferred from the electrons to the filament, and is converted primarily into thermal energy (by transferring kinetic energy to the atoms in the filament), and some light, resulting in visible illumination.
* **Resistance** is created by the filament, slowing the **flow** of the electrons.
* **Potential energy** of the electrons was expended, some converted to electrical (kinetic energy of charged particles) energy as the electrons flowed through the wire (and their position in the wire changed), and some converted to heat/light energy as the electrons slowed down to pass through the filament.
* **The battery** uses chemical energy to internally move electrons back to the negative terminal of the battery, "recharging" their potential energy so that they can do work again in the next round.
