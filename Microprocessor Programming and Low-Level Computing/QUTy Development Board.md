# QUTy Development Board

The QUTy development board is designed for teaching microcontroller programming to beginners. It consists of the following components:

1. **Core Component: ATtiny1626 Microcontroller**

   The ATtiny1626 is an AVR microcontroller from Microchip. It uses an AVR architecture and is popular for educational and small-scale applications.

2. **USB-C Interface**

   * **Power**: Provides electricity to run the board.
   * **Programming** (UPDI): Unified Program and Debug Interface (UPDI) allows you to upload your programs to the microcontroller.
   * **Serial Communication (UART)**: UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) enables data exchange between the board and your computer, useful for debugging or interacting with your programs.

3. **Input and Output (I/O) Components**

   * **Pushbuttons (4x)**: These are physical buttons you can use as input devices. For example, you could write a program to respond when a button is pressed.
   * **Piezo Buzzer**: This creates sound, allowing you to generate simple tones or alerts.
   * **Potentiometer**: A dial-like component that lets you input varying levels of analog signals, often used for adjusting things like adjusting volume or brightness.
   * **2-Digit, 7-Segment LED Display**: Displays numbers or letters, useful for showing data like a counter, timer, or result.
   * **Expansion Header**: A set of pins that allows you to connect additional components or **socket** the board into a **breadboard** (explanation below).

4. **Expansion Header**

   An expansion header is a row (or multiple rows) of small pins sticking out of a circuit board. These pins are connected to the inputs and outputs of the microcontroller on the development board.

   The term "expansion" describes how the header can "expand" the capabilities of the development board by providing access to its internal connections.

   *A **breadboard** is a reusable tool used to build and test electronic circuits without the need to solder anything permanently. It is like a testing platform for circuits.*

5. **Schematic**

   The schematic provides detailed information about how components are interconnected.
