# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

**Data Structures** refer to ways of organising and storing data in a computer so it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

**Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They manipulate data in the structures to perform tasks like searching, sorting, and traversing.

Mastering DSA helps you:

* Solve complex computational problems efficiently.
* Write code that scales well with larger inputs.
* Ace technical interviews.
