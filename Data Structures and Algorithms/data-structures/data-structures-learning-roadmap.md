# Data Structures

### What are Data Structures?

A **data structure** is a way of organising and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. Different data structures are optimised for different types of operations, such as insertion, deletion, searching, and iteration.

### Categories of Data Structures

1. **Linear Data Structures**:
   * Data elements are arranged in a sequence, one after another.
   * Examples:
     * Arrays
     * Linked Lists
     * Stacks
     * Queues
2. **Non-Linear Data Structures**:
   * Data elements are not arranged sequentially and often have hierarchical relationships.
   * Examples:
     * Trees
     * Graphs
     * Heaps

### Data Structures Roadmap

1. [**Arrays**](./Arrays.md): Foundation of most data structures.
2. [**Linked Lists**](Linked%20Lists.md): Dynamic memory-based structure.
3. **Stacks and Queues**: Useful for managing sequential data.
4. **Trees**: Hierarchical data representation.
5. **Graphs**: Relationships between entities.
6. **Hash Tables**: Fast lookups for key-value pairs.
